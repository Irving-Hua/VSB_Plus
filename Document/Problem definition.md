# Problem definition

## Before

Before this project, students are having trouble with course selection, especially for new students.

### Registration

Students often do not know when to select their next semester courses. Because based on the rules of UofR course selection (if I am correct), students with higher Credit Hours earned can select courses early. This rule makes students have to check the course registration site often to prevent missing the date. Some courses can run out of space within one night.

To solve this problem, our project goal is to notify the student of the date to register at the first line of the page after signing in. 
Or students can save the course they want to register for the next semester, and the system will register the selected courses at the first second available, automatically. No more overnight waiting.

### Selection

#### Course Combination

The process of course selection:
  1) Get the chart of courses required by the faculty
  2) Check the courses finished.
  3) Find the courses not finished and not passed.
  4) List the courses available next semester and their prerequisites are passed.
  5) If a lot of courses are available, find the best combination. The Lecture Difficulty, Lecture Time, Professor Preference, etc
  6) If facing elective courses, which courses are available, which courses are recommended?
 
The above steps are problems troubles we facing every semester. Picking the right course combination is the first step to success in the following semester.
A good course combination would also include the students' personal preferences. For instance, the student found not in good mood to study, it is better to have 1 hard, 2 medium, and 1 easy course for the next semester, in order to maintain his GPA.

#### Personalized Academic Calendar

New students often do not know that the school already made an Academic Calendar for them, or they found the school made Academic Calendar is too hard or not suit for them, so they pick the other courses. This would cause wasting in time and money. 

This project should help students personalize their Academic Calendar. Like shifting required courses earlier or later. 
Or make elective course suggestions based on courses already taken and the grade received. 

For example, a student prefers mathematics and logical thinking, it would be a bad idea to take English 110 as an elective.
