# Problem definition

## Before

Before this project, students are having troubles of course selection, espatially for newer students. 

### Registration

Students often do not know when to select their next semester courses. Because based on the rules of UofR course selection (if I am correct), students with higher Credit Hours earned can select course early. This rule makes students have to check the course registration site often to prevent missing the date. Some course can run out of sapce within one night.

To solve this problem, our project goal is to notify the student the date to register at the first line of the page after signed in. 
Or students can save the course they want to register for the next semester, and the system will regist the selected courses at the first second availiable, automatically. No more overnight waiting.

### Selection

#### Course Combination

The process of course selection:
  1) Get the chart of courses required by the faculty
  2) Check the courses finished.
  3) Find the courses not finished and not passed.
  4) List the courses available next semester and their prerequist is passed.
  5) If a lot of courses are availiable, find the best combination. Difficulty, Lecture Time, Professor Preference, etc
  6) If facing elective courses, which courses are availiable, which courses are segisted?
 
The above steps are problems troubles we facing every semester. Picking the right course combination is the first step to success in the following semester.
A good course combination would also include the students personal preference. For instance, the student found not in good mood to study, it is better to have 1 hard, 2 medium, and 1 easy course for the next semester, in order to maintain his GPA.

#### Personalize Academic Calendar 

New students often do not know that school already made an Academic Calendar for them, or they found the school made Academic Calendar is too hard or not suit for them, so they pick the other courses. This would couse a wasting in time and money. 

This project should help students personlize their Academic Calendar. Like shifting required courses earlier or later. 
Or make elective course segistion based on courses already taken and grade recieved. 

For example, a student prefer mathamatics and logicial thinking, it would be a bad idea to take English 110 as elective.
